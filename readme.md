**Modern PHP Testing for everyone** 

Codeception is a modern full-stack testing framework for PHP.
Inspired by BDD, it provides you an absolutely new way of writing acceptance, functional and even unit tests.
Powered by PHPUnit.

#### Contributions

At Codeception we are glad to receive contributions from the community. If you want to send additions or fixes to the code or the documentation please check the [Contributing guide](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/2.0/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### At a Glance

Describe what you test and how you test it. Use PHP to write descriptions faster.

Run tests and see what actions were taken and what results were seen.

#### Sample acceptance test

``` php
<?php

$I = new FunctionalTester($scenario);
$I->wantTo('create wiki page');
$I->amOnPage('/');
$I->click('Pages');
$I->click('New');
$I->see('New Page');
$I->submitForm('form#new_page', array('title' => 'Tree of Life Movie Review','body' => "Next time don't let Hollywood create art-house!"));
$I->see('page created'); // notice generated
$I->see('Tree of Life Movie Review','h1'); // head of page of is our title
$I->seeInCurrentUrl('pages/tree-of-life-movie-review'); // slug is generated
$I->seeInDatabase('pages', array('title' => 'Tree of Life Movie Review')); // data is stored in database
?>
```

For unit testing you can stay on classic PHPUnit tests, as Codeception can run them too.
