**Modern PHP Testing for everyone** 

Codeception is a modern full-stack testing framework for PHP.
Inspired by BDD, it provides you an absolutely new way of writing acceptance, functional and even unit tests.
Powered by PHPUnit.

#### Contributions

##### Code

**Bugfixes should be sent to to current stable branch, which is the same as major version number.**
Breaking features and major improvements should be sent into `master`. When you send PRs to master, they will be added to release cycle only when the next stable branch is started.

Check also the "tests/README.md" to learn more about the available internal Codeception tests.

##### Documentation

The documentation for each module is directly generated from the corresponding docblock which can be found in each module (src/Module/Codeception/*.php).

### At a Glance

Describe what you test and how you test it. Use PHP to write descriptions faster.

Run tests and see what actions were taken and what results were seen.

#### Sample acceptance test

``` php
<?php

$I = new FunctionalTester($scenario);
$I->wantTo('create wiki page');
$I->amOnPage('/');
$I->click('Pages');
$I->click('New');
$I->see('New Page');
$I->submitForm('form#new_page', array('title' => 'Tree of Life Movie Review','body' => "Next time don't let Hollywood create art-house!"));
$I->see('page created'); // notice generated
$I->see('Tree of Life Movie Review','h1'); // head of page of is our title
$I->seeInCurrentUrl('pages/tree-of-life-movie-review'); // slug is generated
$I->seeInDatabase('pages', array('title' => 'Tree of Life Movie Review')); // data is stored in database
?>
```

For unit testing you can stay on classic PHPUnit tests, as Codeception can run them too.
