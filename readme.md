**Modern PHP Testing for everyone**

Codeception is a modern full-stack testing framework for PHP.
Inspired by BDD, it provides an absolutely new way of writing acceptance, functional and even unit tests.
Powered by PHPUnit.

#### Contributions

At Codeception we are glad to receive contributions from the community. If you want to send additions or fixes to the code or the documentation please check the [Contributing guide](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/2.4/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### At a Glance

Describe what you test and how you test it. Use PHP to write descriptions faster.

Run tests and see what actions were taken and what results were seen.

#### Sample test

``` php
$I->wantTo('create wiki page');
$I->amOnPage('/');
$I->click('Pages');
$I->click('New');
$I->see('New Page');
$I->submitForm('form#new_page', ['title' => 'Movie Review']);
$I->see('page created'); // notice generated
$I->see('Movie Review','h1'); // head of page of is our title
$I->seeInCurrentUrl('pages/movie-review'); // slug is generated
$I->seeInDatabase('pages', ['title' => 'Movie Review']); // data is stored in database
```

For unit testing you can stay on classic PHPUnit tests, as Codeception can run them too.
