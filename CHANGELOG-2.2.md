#### 2.2.1

* PHPUnit 5.4 and PHPUnit/php-code-coverage 4.0 compatibility.

#### 2.2.0

* **Gherkin format support**. [Announcement](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/pull/2750#issue-129899745)
* **Core Test Format Refactorings** Codeception becomes true multiformat testing platform. Format requires a [Loader](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/master/src/Codeception/Test/Loader/LoaderInterface.php) and class extending [Test](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/master/src/Codeception/Test/Test.php) class, implementing [TestInterface](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/master/src/Codeception/TestInterface.php).
    * *Breaking* `Codeception\TestCase` replaced with `Codeception\TestInterface` in code and in module signatures.
    * *Breaking* Cept/Cest classes are no longer extending `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase`, so they don't have `expectException`, `getMock`, etc.
    * Reduced stack trace for scenario-driven test formats. Codeception tests implement `PHPUnit_Framework_Test` instead of extending heavy `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase` class.
* *Breaking* **Conflicts API implemented** Frameworks + PhpBrowser + WebDriver can't be used together unless only non-conflicting part is used. [Announcement](http://codeception.com/03-05-2016/codeception-2.2.-upcoming-features.html#conflicts)
