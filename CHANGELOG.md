* **Config validation** with `codecept config:validate` command. Use it:

#### 2.2.0

* **Gherkin format support**. [Announcement](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/pull/2750#issue-129899745)
* **Core Test Format Refactorings** Codeception becomes true multiformat testing platform. Format requires a [Loader](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/master/src/Codeception/Test/Loader/LoaderInterface.php) and class extending [Test](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/master/src/Codeception/Test/Test.php) class, implementing [TestInterface](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/blob/master/src/Codeception/TestInterface.php).
    * *Breaking* `Codeception\TestCase` replaced with `Codeception\TestInterface` in code and in module signatures.
    * *Breaking* Cept/Cest classes are no longer extending `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase`, so they don't have `expectException`, `getMock`, etc.
    * Reduced stack trace for scenario-driven test formats. Codeception tests implement `PHPUnit_Framework_Test` instead of extending heavy `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase` class.
* *Breaking* **Conflicts API implemented** Frameworks + PhpBrowser + WebDriver can't be used together unless only non-conflicting part is used. [Announcement](http://codeception.com/03-05-2016/codeception-2.2.-upcoming-features.html#conflicts)
* **Examples** as an alternative to Data Providers. [Announcement](http://codeception.com/03-10-2016/even-more-features-of-codeception.html#examples)
* **Params** loading from yml, env files or environment. [Announcement](http://codeception.com/03-05-2016/codeception-2.2.-upcoming-features.html#params)
* **Test dependencies** with `@depends` annotation. [Announcement](http://codeception.com/03-05-2016/codeception-2.2.-upcoming-features.html#test-dependencies)
* **Custom Commands** inject your own commands as as simple as extension. [Announcement](http://codeception.com/03-10-2016/even-more-features-of-codeception.html#custom-commands)
* `codecept dry-run` command added to show scenario steps without executing them.
* *Breaking* [Dbh] module removed
* *Breaking* [Laravel4] module removed. See #2866

* [Redis] Module rewritten using Predis library as driver by @marcverney
* [Laravel5] Added a `haveMultiple` method to create more than one model per call. See #2866

  Annotations can be parsed from line or block comments. `$scenario->skip()` and `$scenario->incomplete()` are still valid and can be executed inside conditional statements:
  ```
  if (!extension_loaded('xdebug')) $scenario->skip('Xdebug required')
  ```
* **PSR-4**: all support classes moved to `tests/_support` by default. Actors, Helpers, PageObjects, StepObjects, GroupObjects to follow PSR-4 naming style. Autoloader implemented by @splinter89.

* **Dependencies**: module can explicitly define dependencies and expect their injection by implementing `_inject` and `_depends` methods and relying on dependency injection container.
