# Testing WebServices

The same way we tested a web site Codeception allows you to test web services. They are very hard to test manually, so it's really good idea to automate web service testing. As a standards we have SOAP and REST which are represented in corresponding modules. We will cover them in this chapter.

You should start with creating a new test suite, which was not provided by the `bootstrap` command. We recommend to call it **api** and use the ApiGuy class for it.

```
$ php codecept.phar generate:suite api ApiGuy
```

We will put all the api tests there.


## REST

The REST web service is accessed via HTTP with standard methods: GET, POST, PUT (PATCH), DELETE. They allow to receive and manipulate entities from the service. Accessing WebService requires an HTTP client, so for using it you need the module `PhpBrowser` or one of framework modules set up. For example, we can use the Symfony2 module for Symfony2 applications in order to ignore web server and test web service internally.

Configure modules in `api.suite.yml`:

``` yaml
class_name: ApiGuy
modules:
    enabled: [PhpBrowser, REST, ApiHelper]
    config:
		PhpBrowser:
			url: http://serviceapp/
		REST:
		    url: http://serviceapp/api/v1/
```

The REST module will automatically connect to PhpBrowser. In case you provide it with Symfony2, Zend, or other framework module, it will connect to them as well. Don't forget to run the `build` command once you finished editing configuration.

Let's create the first sample test:

```
php codecept.phar generate:cept api CreateUser
```

It will be called `CreateUserCept.php`. We can use it to test creation of user via web service.

``` php
<?php
$I = new ApiGuy($scenario);
$I->wantTo('create a user via API');
$I->amHttpAuthenticated('service_user','123456');
$I->haveHttpHeader('Content-Type','application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
$I->sendPOST('users', array('name' => 'davert', 'email' => 'davert@codeception.com'));
$I->seeResponseCodeIs(200);
$I->seeResponseIsJson();
$I->seeResponseContains('{ result: ok}');
?>
```

REST module is designed to be used with services that serve responses in JSON format. For example, method `seeResponseContainsJson` will convert provided array to json and check if response contains it.

You may want to perform more complex assertions of response. This can be done with writing your own methods in [Helper](http://codeception.com/docs/03-Modules#helpers) classes. To access the latest JSON response you will need to get `response` property of REST module. Let's demonstrate it with `seeResponseIsHtml` method:

``` php
<?php
class ApiHelper extends \Codeception\Module {

	public function seeResponseIsHtml()
	{
		$response = $this->getModule('REST')->response;
		\PHPUnit_Framework_Assert::assertRegex('^<html>.*?<\/html>$', $response);
	}
}
?>
```

The same way you can receive request parameters and headers.

## SOAP

SOAP web services are often more complex. You will need PHP [configured with SOAP support](http://php.net/manual/en/soap.installation.php). Good knowledge of XML is required too. SOAP module uses specially formatted POST request to connect to WSDL web services. Codeception uses PhpBrowser or one of framework modules to perform interaction. If you choose using a framework module, SOAP automatically connect to the underliying framework. That may improve the speed of a test execution and will provide you with more detailed stack traces.

Let's configure SOAP module to be used with PhpBrowser:

``` yaml

class_name: ApiGuy
modules:
    enabled: [PhpBrowser, SOAP, ApiHelper]
    config:
		PhpBrowser:
			url: http://serviceapp/
		SOAP:
		    endpoint: http://serviceapp/api/v1/
```

SOAP request may contain application specific information, like authentication or payment. This information is provided with SOAP header inside the `<soap:Header>` element of XML request. In case you need to submit such header you can use `haveSoapHeader` action. For example, next line of code

``` php
<?php
$I->haveSoapHeader('Auth', array('username' => 'Miles', 'password' => '123456'));
?>
```
will produce this XML header

``` xml
<soap:Header>
<Auth>
	<username>Miles</username>
	<password>123456</password>
</Auth>
</soap:Header>
```

Use `sendSoapRequest` method to define the body of your request.

``` php
<?php
$I->sendSoapRequest('CreateUser', '<name>Miles Davis</name><email>miles@davis.com</email>');
?>
```

This call will be translated to XML:

``` xml
<soap:Body>
<ns:CreateUser>
	<name>Miles Davis</name>
	<email>miles@davis.com</email>
</ns:CreateUser>
</soap:Body>
```

And here is the list of sample assertions that can be used with SOAP.

``` php
<?php
$I->seeSoapResponseEquals('<?xml version="1.0"?><error>500</error>');
$I->seeSoapResponseIncludes('<result>1</result>');
$I->seeSoapResponseContainsStructure('<user><name></name><email></email>');
$I->seeSoapResponseContainsXPath('//result/user/name[@id=1]');
?>
```

In case you don't want to write long XML strings, consider using [XmlBuilder](http://codeception.com/docs/reference/xmlbuilder) class. It will help you to build complex XMLs in jQuery-like style.
In next example we will use `XmlBuilder` (created from SoapUtils factory) instead of regular XMLs.

``` php
<?php
use \Codeception\Utils\Soap;

$I = new ApiGuy($scenario);
$I->wantTo('create user');
$I->haveSoapHeader('Session', array('token' => '123456'));
$I->sendSoapRequest('CreateUser', Soap::request()->user->email->val('miles@davis.com'));
$I->seeSoapResponseIncludes(Soap::response()
	->result->val('Ok')
		->user->attr('id', 1)
);
?>
```
It's up to you to decide whether to use XmlBuilder or string XMLs. XmlBuilder will return XML string as well.

You may extend current functionality by using SOAP module in your helper class. To access the SOAP response as `\DOMDocument` you can use `response` property of SOAP module.

``` php
<?php
class ApiHelper extends \Codeception\Module {

	public function seeResponseIsValidOnSchema($schema)
	{
		$response = $this->getModule('SOAP')->response;
		$this->assertTrue($response->schemaValidate($schema));
	}
}
?>
```

## Conclusion

Codeception has two modules that will help you to test various web services. They need a new `api` suite to be created. Remember, you are not limited to test only response body. By including Db module you may check if a user was created after the `CreateUser` call. You can improve testing scenarios by using REST or SOAP responses in your helper methods.
