I WANT TO GENERATE SAMPLE CEPT

I am in path "tests/data/sandbox"
I execute command "generate:cept dummy DummyCept"
I see file found ["DummyCept.php","tests/dummy"]
I see in this file "$I = new DumbGuy($scenario);"
I delete this file 

...I am going to create scenario in folder 
I execute command "generate:cept dummy path/DummyCept"
I see file found ["DummyCept.php","tests/dummy/path"]
I delete this file 

...I am going to create file with cest.php suffix 
I execute command "generate:cept dummy DummyCept.php"
I see file found "DummyCept.php"
I delete this file 

...I am going to create file without any suffix 
I execute command "generate:cept dummy Dummy"
I see file found "DummyCept.php"
